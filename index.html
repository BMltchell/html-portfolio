        <h1>The Best Movies According to Brett</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time! </h2>
<hr />
<h3>Exodus</h3>
This depicts the Exodus from the Bible. The CGI is top notch and can never go wrong with Christian Bale as Moses!
<br />
<br />
<h3>Gods of Egypt</h3>
If you love ancient egypt, this would be a fun watch. CGI is also really well made in this movie. The main antagonist is played by Gerard Butler and what can I say, Im a Butler fan!
<br />
<br />
<h3>Maze Runner</h3>
This movie is action packed and keeps you invested the entire time. The main actor Dylan O'brien absolutely kills it not only in this movie, but every Maze Runner Sequel after. If you want to binge watch a movie sequel, then Maze Runner should be your first choice!
